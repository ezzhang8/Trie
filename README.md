# Trie
This is the repository containing all necessary files for my submission of the take-home challenge. 
I created a Express server with Node.js to complete the task of maintaining a trie with a global state and performing operations on said data in the trie.

# Overview
The command-line interface and the server are all programmed in Node.js. For hosting, I opted for DigitalOcean as it was a service I had used before, and is relatively simple for this project. I chose JavaScript as my language of choice due to its robust support of JSON, a hierarchical file format I believed would significantly help me with creating a trie.

**For more details, please read the README in the cli and server folders, respectively.**

# Reflection

This project was the most intensive project, programming or otherwise, I've ever had to complete on a deadline. I gained a much deeper understanding of technologies that would've taken me a much longer time at my own leisure to learn, such as the trie (of course), but also learning software development for the command line, backend skills, algorithms for trees, and advanced troubleshooting. I am also proud to have taken my own initiative and direction with this project, creating a product that is original to me. Regardless of the outcome, I wouldn't trade this experience for anything else, this project alone has pushed my capabilities beyond where they were just a short week ago.
